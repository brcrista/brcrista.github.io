I'm Brian.  I make my living as a software engineer.  I started my career at Microsoft in 2015.  Since 2019, I've been at GitHub, where I now work as an engineering manager.

Over the years, I've helped build:
- GitHub Actions
- Azure Pipelines
- Windows 10
- Microsoft Defender
- Microsoft Edge

I read a lot.  I pretend to work more than I do.  I live in Raleigh, NC.
