I'm Brian.  I make my living as a software engineer.  I started my career at Microsoft in 2015.  Since 2019, I've been at GitHub, where I now work as an engineering manager.

Over the years, I've helped build:
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines/)
- [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10)
- [Microsoft Defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Defender)
- [Microsoft Edge Legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge#Edge_Legacy_(2014%E2%80%932019))

Also, I read a lot.  I live in Raleigh, NC.
